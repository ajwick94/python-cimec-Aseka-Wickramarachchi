ðŸŽ§ ITD-based Sound Localization Experiment

This project simulates sound localization cues using Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and a simple Interaural Level Difference (ILD) model. It also implements a Just Noticeable Difference (JND) experiment to measure a listenerâ€™s sensitivity to spatial audio cues in the horizontal plane.

ðŸ“– Overview

generate_ITD.py - class

Implements a psychoacoustic model (Woodworthâ€™s ITD model) with fractional delay processing to spatialize audio over headphones.
Simulates ITDs based on head radius and speed of sound.
Applies simple ILDs to mimic natural level differences between ears.
Can generate and play test tones or save stereo signals as WAV files.

jnd_experiment.py - class

Runs a 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) psychophysics experiment:
Participant hears two sounds (one centered, one shifted by an angle).
Task: identify which sound was further to the left.
Uses an adaptive staircase procedure to adjust difficulty.
Logs responses, tracks reversals, and plots localization performance.

This is a simple experiment that mimics auditory perception research methods used to measure accuracy in sound locaslisation and spatial hearing.
